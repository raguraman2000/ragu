    <p>
      The falls has about 14 channels with drops varying between 15 & 65 ft. To reach the surroundings of waterfalls one needs to take a boat-ride (there is no land access). Coracle riding is one of the main attractions here which is allowed during the monsoon and winter season. Boating is usually stopped in peak monsoons. Hogenakkal is also the good place to try out your swimming skills. The water is quite challenging. Tourists can also go for trekking on the nearby surrounding hills as part of Hogenakkal tour packages. The water from the fall flows towards the Mettur Dam which is also known as the Stanley Reservoir.</p>
      <p>Often referred to as the 'Niagara of India', Hogenakkal is also one of the wonderful tourist places to visit near Bangalore & Chennai. When the River Kaveri enters the Tamil Nadu border after winding its way through the state of Karnataka, it descends down the lofty landscape forming the Hogenakkal Waterfalls. The Carbonatite rocks found near the waterfall are one of the oldest in the world. The two Kannada words 'Hoge' means 'Smoke' and 'Kal' means 'Rocks' give meaning to the word Hogenakkal as Smoky Rocks. It is also called as Marikottayam by the people of Tamil Nadu</p>

	  <p>At Hogenakal the water spreads for miles around and on these waters cruising on country made dinghies (PARISAL) is possible.  Parisal ride will give an enthralling experience. Surrounding by hills at various heights Hogenakal offers the visitors a different ambience and refreshing relaxations. One could also take bath in the falls.  Oil massaging by local people is a different experience.  As the river flows throughout the year Hogenakal can be visited all days through the year.  There are enough transport facility available from Dharmapuri & Krishnagiri.</p>

    <p>The Kaveri is considered to form at Talakaveri in the Brahmagiri hills in the Western Ghats of
       south India and gathers momentum as the land drops in elevation. It becomes larger as various
        tributaries feed into it on the way down.[2] At Hogenakkal, the Kaveri, now a large river,
         drops and creates numerous waterfalls as the water cuts through the rocky terrain. In places
          the water falls as much as 20 m (66 ft) and is said to sound like continual thunder</p>
