  <p>"rihadeeshwara Temple (Peruvudaiyar Kovil) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva located in Thanjavur in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is also known as Periya Kovil, RajaRajeswara Temple and Rajarajesvaram. It is one of the largest temples in India and is an example of Dravidian architecture during the Chola period.
    <br> Built by emperor Raja Raja Chola I and completed in 1010 AD, the temple turned 1000 years old in 2010. The temple is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the “Great Living Chola Temples”, with the other two being the Brihadeeswarar Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram and Airavatesvara temple.

The Kumbam (the apex or the bulbous structure on the top) of the temple is carved out of a single rock and weighs around 80 tons.

		<h1>History</h1>
		<img src="image/tha.jpg">
		<p>The Tanjore Big Temple is a stunning monument built by Raja Raja Cholan, greatest king of Chola Dynasty. It was constructed between the year AD 985 and 1014, completed around 1010 AD. The temple is popularly known as the Big Temple, Rajarajesvaram Temple or Peruvudaiyār Kōvil temple. It highlights the architectural mastery of the Chola era. The Thanjavur temple is mainly dedicated to Lord Shiva because the Raja Raja Cholan is the ardent devotee of Lord Shiva. The great temple was built to signify the Chola’s brilliant achievements in architecture, painting, bronze casting and sculpture. Brihadeeswarar temple is one of the few temples that have Ashta-dikpalakas (dik – direction & palakas – ruler. Dikpalakas – ruler of the directions). Brihadeeswarar temple Thanjavur, is the first complete granite temple in the world with more than 130,000 tons.</p>

<p>What astounds historians is that there was not a single granite quarry in about 100 km radius of
   the temple. This means that transporting these stones would have been a herculean task. 
   But Raja Raja Cholan insisted on the use of these stones. All of these features make this
   Chola temple of Tanjore, a magnum opus of the Chola reign.

  Brihadeeswarar temple is one of the few temples that have Ashta-dikpaalakas (Guardians of the
   directions) idols. Chola frescoes adorn the wall of the temple and these frescoes depict Shiva in
    different poses. Brihadeeswarar temple is the first complete granite temple in the world. Around 
    60,000 tons of granite is said to be used to build the temple</p>
